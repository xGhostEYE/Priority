# Priori

Priori is an online service aimed at helping students prioritize tasks necessary to achieve the grades they want. This is done by syncronizing with a school's server and aquiring all the assignments, quizes, exams, and labs that a student needs to complete. This data as well as the student's desired grade and current grade are fed into an algorithm to help determine their study plan. 

## Features

### Easy to use UI/UX
- The UI is designed with Apple design principles in mind; Making it simple to use but maintaining a balance with elegance.

- Important information like the study plan for the day draw the user's attention. This is contrasted by tasks that need to be done later in the week below it.

### Study Time Recomendations
- Each class will display a percentage of its importance to a student's success. Along with data mentioned earlier, it also takes into account the student's major to more heavily prioritize its requirements.

### Algorithmic Decision Making
- The algorithm works by applying a score value to the tasks a student must complete. This value is then used to calculate how important a task is and how much time should be allocated to it. The due date for the task also plays a large role in this.

- Tasks like exams that are 2 weeks away will get nearly equivalent priority as an assignment due in 1 week. This is because exams are worth more to the final grade and require more study time to get a good grade in.




### Database Usage
- A database keeps track of all the students accounts and the data related to them. It also gets syncronized with the school's servers periodically. This makes sure the user always has up to date recommendations for what tasks need to be focused on.
